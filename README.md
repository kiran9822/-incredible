- Project Description
The Partially Occluded Face Recognition System is an advanced Deep Learning-based application designed to recognize faces even when partially obscured. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Computer Vision techniques to handle real-world challenges like masks, sunglasses, and other obstructions.


-Face Detection & Recognition – Accurately detects and identifies faces in images, even when partially occluded.
- Occlusion Handling – Handles various types of occlusions like masks, glasses, and shadows.
- Deep Learning Model – Uses a CNN-based architecture for feature extraction and classification.
- Dataset Preprocessing – Normalizes and augments datasets to improve model accuracy.
- Real-time Face Recognition – Can be integrated with a webcam for real-time face recognition.
